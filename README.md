## üÜï News
- \[**August 2024**\] We have released the first version (v1) and are very excited to share our research and insights into Pulsar Candidate Classification!

## Usage
### üõ†Ô∏è Environmental installation
We strongly recommend using SWIFT from the modelscope community to reproduce or use our model, which runs in a Python environment. Please ensure that your Python version is higher than 3.8.

- Install SWIFT using the pip commandÔºö

```shell
# all
pip install 'ms-swift[all]' -U
# only LLM
pip install 'ms-swift[llm]' -U
```
