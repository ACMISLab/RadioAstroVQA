## ðŸ†• News
- \[**August 2024**\] We have released the first version (v1) and are very excited to share our research and insights into Pulsar Candidate Classification!

## ðŸš€ Usage
We strongly recommend using SWIFT from the modelscope community to reproduce or use our model, which runs in a Python environment. Please ensure that your Python version is higher than 3.8.

- Install SWIFT using the pip commandï¼š

```shell
# all
pip install 'ms-swift[all]' -U
# only LLM
pip install 'ms-swift[llm]' -U
```

If you wish to reproduce the corresponding PICS-ResNet or HCCNN on the HTRU Medlat dataset, you may need to use the training and evaluation codes under the 'pics_ccnn_model' file. 

At the same time, you will need to install the corresponding PyTorch environment. If you wish to reproduce our feature selection process, please use the code under the 'feature_choose' file.

##  ðŸ“– Experiment Results
We fine-tuned all layers of the MLLM, optimizing both its textual and visual elements, to effectively address the multimodal demands of radio signal classification.  You can find detailed experimental information in the table below.
